## Edge Bar Details

### Left vs. Right Edge Bar

Configurable in [App Settings](/docs/settings/app-settings/):
- **Show left edge bar** - Status appears on left side
- **Show right edge bar** - Status appears on right side
- **Show both** - Redundant but highly visible
- **Hide both** - Clean interface, no status indicators

### Status Priority

If a card has multiple statuses, the edge bar shows:
1. **Sync status** (if recently synced) - Orange/Green
2. **Forgotten status** (if marked "Again") - Red
3. **Learning status** (if being studied) - Yellow/Green
4. **Disabled status** (if disabled) - Gray
