Study Mode is where the learning happens! GoCards uses **spaced repetition** to help you memorize efficiently by showing cards at optimal intervals.

## Starting a Study Session

GoCards automatically selects which cards to show based on:
- Cards you've never seen before
- Cards due for review today
- Cards you marked as "Again" recently

### Navigation

- **Swipe left/right** - Move between cards
- **Tap bottom section** - Reveal the definition (answer)
- **Tap anywhere** after reveal - Shows grading buttons

## The Four Grading Buttons

After revealing the answer, grade how well you remembered:

### 🔴 Again (Red)

**Use when:** You forgot the card completely

**What happens:**
- Card stays in the current study session
- Reappears after you've studied/forgotten 5 more cards
- Next review: **2 days** (or current interval if already learned)
- Marks card as "forgotten" (visible in card list edge bar)

**Customization:** Change the "forgotten card limit" in [Deck Settings](/docs/settings/deck-settings/)

---

### 🟠 Quick Repetition (Orange)

**Use when:** Cramming for an exam or need short-term recall

**What happens:**
- First review: **5 minutes**
- Second review: **10 minutes**
- Third review: **20 minutes**
- Intervals keep doubling

**Perfect for:**
- Last-minute studying before exams
- Memorizing information needed in the next few hours
- Intensive drilling of difficult material

---

### 🔵 Hard (Blue)

**Use when:** You remembered, but it took effort

**What happens:**

If this is your **first time** grading the card:
- Next review: **3 days**
- Subsequent reviews: **interval × 1.5**

If you previously clicked **"Again"**:
- Updates the failed attempt with **interval × 0.5**
- Creates new review with **interval × 1.5**

**Example progression:**
1. First: 3 days
2. Second: 4.5 days (3 × 1.5)
3. Third: 6.75 days (4.5 × 1.5)

---

### 🟢 Easy (Green)

**Use when:** You remembered quickly and confidently

**What happens:**

If this is your **first time** grading the card:
- Next review: **5 days**
- Subsequent reviews: **interval × 2**

If you previously clicked **"Again"**:
- Updates the failed attempt with **interval × 0.5**
- Marks card as memorized

**Example progression:**
1. First: 5 days
2. Second: 10 days (5 × 2)
3. Third: 20 days (10 × 2)
4. Fourth: 40 days (20 × 2)

## Understanding Review Intervals

The interval shown below each button is **when you'll see this card again**.

### How Intervals Work

**New cards** (never studied):
- Again: 2 days
- Quick: 5 minutes
- Hard: 3 days
- Easy: 5 days

**Previously studied cards:**
- Intervals adapt based on your history
- More "Easy" clicks = longer intervals
- "Again" clicks = shorter intervals
- The algorithm balances memory retention with study efficiency

### Why These Intervals?

GoCards uses **spaced repetition** based on memory research:
- Review just before you're about to forget
- Longer intervals strengthen long-term memory
- Too frequent = waste of time
- Too infrequent = you'll forget

---

## Study Session Flow

### When Cards Appear

1. **New cards** - Never studied before
2. **Due cards** - Review interval has passed
3. **Forgotten cards** - Recently marked "Again"

### Session Length

A study session includes:
- All due cards (scheduled for today or earlier)
- Up to 20 new cards (configurable)
- "Again" cards loop back into current session

You can study as long as you want. The session ends when:
- No more cards are due
- You've studied all new cards
- You press the back button

### "No More Cards" Screen

When you've finished:
- Congratulations message appears
- Shows how many cards you studied
- Option to continue browsing all cards
- Back button returns to deck menu

---

## Study Progress Tracking

### Edge Bars (Visible in Card List)

After studying, open "List Cards" to see:

**Left/Right edge bars** show card status:
- **🔴 Red** - Forgotten (marked "Again")
- **🟡 Yellow** - Learning (seen but not mastered)
- **🟢 Green** - Mastered (long intervals)
- **Color intensity** - How recently the card was studied

See [Cards List - Edge Bars](/docs/cards-list/#edge-bars) for details.

### Learning Statistics

GoCards tracks:
- Total cards studied
- Cards memorized vs. forgotten
- Study streaks
- Time spent studying
- Cards due today

*(Statistics screen coming soon)*

## Tips for Effective Studying

### Be Honest with Yourself
- Don't mark "Easy" if you hesitated
- Use "Again" freely - it helps you learn
- The algorithm works best with accurate feedback

### Consistency Over Duration
- **Better:** 10 minutes daily
- **Worse:** 70 minutes once a week
- Spaced repetition requires regular reviews

### Use "Quick" Strategically
- Great for cramming before tests
- Don't use as default - defeats spaced repetition
- Switch to Hard/Easy for long-term learning

### Don't Skip "Again" Cards
- These are your weakest cards
- Will reappear in current session
- Master them before moving on

### Adjust Settings
- Increase forgotten card limit if sessions are too short
- Decrease if you're overwhelmed
- See [Deck Settings](/docs/settings/deck-settings/)
