## Study mode
Let's start by creating a sample deck and exploring the study mode. Navigating between cards is as simple as sliding them left or right.

At the top, you will find the term, representing the front of the card. 
Take a moment to check if you still remember this card. 
Then when you are ready, click the bottom part to reveal the definition, representing the back of the card. 
Below are buttons that allow you to assess how well you know the card.

### “Again” and the limit forgotten cards
If you hit “Again”, the card stays in the stack and pops up again after studying and forgetting another 5 cards. 
You have the flexibility to customize this value or disable the feature in the Deck Settings.

### “Quick repetition”
The next button “Quick repetition” is designed for last-minute cramming e.g. before tomorrow's exam. 
Tap it and the card reappears quite quickly, first after 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, followed by 20 minutes, and so on.

### “Hard” and “Easy”
Depending on how well you are confident with the material, use the 'Hard' or 'Easy' button. 
“Hard” brings the card back in 3 days, with subsequent intervals increasing the days by 1.5 times. 
“Easy” brings the card back in 5 days, with subsequent doubling days.

### Gestures
GoCards prioritizes an interactive user experience by avoiding complicated configuration options in the settings. 
Instead, it offers intuitive gestures for adjusting display settings. 
You can change the aspect ratio of terms and definitions by moving a middle bar. 
You can also adjust text size by zooming in or out. 
Display settings can be easily reset to their default setup using the "Reset view" menu option.

### Actions
In the study mode you can also delete cards, edit cards and add create a new card.

#### Undo
Have you accidentally pressed the button or removed the card? 
Don’t worry, you can easily undo the last action by pressing the "Back" button. Let’s tap the rating button. 
Changed your mind? Just press “Back”. Let’s add a new card, now undo it. 
Removed a card you didn't mean to? Let’s bring it back. 
To exit the study mode, simply tap the back arrow located in the top toolbar. 
Now, let's move on to the next activity with a list of all the cards.

-	Search for cards using text
