    "content": "{/*\n  IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:\n  1. Add screenshot: Browse mode interface (no grading buttons)\n  2. Add screenshot: Comparison view (Study mode vs Browse mode side-by-side)\n  3. Note: Verify if Browse is Premium feature (conflicting info in codebase analysis)\n  */}\n\nBrowse Mode lets you view all your cards in a carousel format **without grading or affecting your study progress**. It's perfect for quick reviews, previewing content, or sharing cards with others.\n\n## What is Browse Mode?\n\nBrowse Mode is a **view-only** version of Study Mode:\n\n| Feature | Study Mode | Browse Mode |\n|---------|-----------|-------------|\n| **View term & definition** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n| **Swipe between cards** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n| **Grading buttons** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n| **Affects study progress** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n| **Edit/delete cards** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n| **Shows all cards** | ❌ Only due cards | ✅ All cards |\n| **Interactive gestures** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (zoom, resize) |\n\n***\n\n## When to Use Browse Mode\n\n### Perfect for:\n\n**📋 Quick Review**\n\n* Skim through all cards before an exam\n* Refresh your memory without changing study schedule\n* Preview deck content before committing to study\n\n**👀 Preview New Decks**\n\n* Check out a deck's contents before studying\n* See what's in an imported deck\n* Verify cards after syncing with a file\n\n**🤝 Sharing with Others**\n\n* Show cards to a study partner\n* Demo the deck to someone\n* Collaborate on deck content\n\n**🔍 Finding Specific Cards**\n\n* Quickly navigate to a card you need\n* Check if certain content exists\n* Locate cards to edit later\n\n**📊 Content Audit**\n\n* Review all cards systematically\n* Check for errors or duplicates\n* Verify formatting and images\n\n### Not recommended for:\n\n* ❌ Active learning (use [Study Mode](/docs/study/) instead)\n* ❌ Editing cards (use [Edit Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/) or [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/))\n* ❌ Memorization practice (use Study Mode for spaced repetition)\n\n***\n\n## Starting Browse Mode\n\nFrom the home screen:\n\n1. **Tap on a deck** to open deck menu\n2. **Select \"Browse Cards\"**\n3. **All cards appear** in carousel view\n\nFrom cards list:\n\n1. **Open \"List Cards\"**\n2. **Tap \"⋮\" menu** (top-right)\n3. **Select \"Browse Cards\"**\n\n***\n\n## The Browse Screen Interface\n\n### Card Layout\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────┐\n│      [← Back button]        │\n├─────────────────────────────┤\n│                             │\n│        TERM (Question)      │ ← Top section\n│                             │\n├─────────────────────────────┤ ← Drag to resize\n│                             │\n│     DEFINITION (Answer)     │ ← Bottom section\n│                             │\n│        (always visible)     │\n└─────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Key Differences from Study Mode\n\n**No grading buttons** - Just view and swipe\n**No card actions** - Can't edit, delete, or add cards\n**Definition always revealed** - No need to tap to show answer\n**Shows all cards** - Not filtered by due date\n**Minimal toolbar** - Just a back button\n\n***\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Swiping Between Cards\n\n* **Swipe left** - Next card\n* **Swipe right** - Previous card\n* **Smooth animations** - Easy on the eyes\n* **Loop to beginning** - Swiping past the last card goes back to first\n\n### Card Counter\n\n*(If enabled)*\n\n* Shows current position (e.g., \"Card 5 of 42\")\n* Helps track progress through deck\n* Located at top of screen\n\n### Exiting Browse Mode\n\n* **Tap back arrow** (top-left)\n* **Device back button**\n* Returns to previous screen (deck menu or cards list)\n\n***\n\n## Interactive Features\n\nEven though you can't grade cards, Browse Mode still supports:\n\n### Pinch to Zoom\n\n**Gesture:** Pinch out/in on any card section\n\n**Use case:**\n\n* Read small text\n* Examine image details\n* Adjust for readability\n\nZoom level persists across cards in the session.\n\n### Adjust Term/Definition Ratio\n\n**Gesture:** Drag the horizontal bar between sections\n\n**Use case:**\n\n* Optimize screen space\n* Show more of longer content\n* Match your reading preference\n\nRatio persists across cards in the session.\n\n### HTML Content Support\n\nBrowse Mode fully renders:\n\n* **Bold/italic text** (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)\n* **Images** (`<img>` tags)\n* **Links** (clickable)\n* **Lists** (`<ul>`, `<ol>`)\n\nSee [Cards List - Formatting](/docs/cards-list/formatting/) for HTML details.\n\n***\n\n## Use Cases in Detail\n\n### 1. Pre-Exam Quick Review\n\n**Scenario:** Your exam starts in 30 minutes. You want to skim all cards one last time without messing up your spaced repetition schedule.\n\n**How:**\n\n1. Open deck → \"Browse Cards\"\n2. Swipe through all cards quickly\n3. Jog your memory without clicking grading buttons\n4. Exit and head to your exam confident\n\n**Why Browse Mode?** Study Mode would mark cards as \"due\" and change review intervals.\n\n***\n\n### 2. Verify Sync Changes\n\n**Scenario:** You edited cards in Excel and synced. You want to make sure all changes imported correctly.\n\n**How:**\n\n1. After sync completes, tap deck → \"Browse Cards\"\n2. Swipe through cards looking for your edits\n3. Verify content, formatting, images\n4. Exit satisfied (or go to [Edit Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/) if fixes needed)\n\n**Why Browse Mode?** Faster than opening each card in cards list. No accidental study progress.\n\n***\n\n### 3. Find a Specific Card\n\n**Scenario:** You remember a card with a specific term but forgot which position it's in.\n\n**How:**\n\n1. Open deck → \"Browse Cards\"\n2. Swipe through quickly\n3. Find the card\n4. Exit and open [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/) if you need to edit it\n\n**Alternative:** Use search in [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/#searching-cards) for text-based searches.\n\n***\n\n### 4. Teach Someone Else\n\n**Scenario:** You're tutoring a friend and want to show them your flashcard deck.\n\n**How:**\n\n1. Open deck → \"Browse Cards\"\n2. Hand them your phone\n3. They swipe through and read\n4. No risk of accidentally grading cards or changing your progress\n\n**Why Browse Mode?** Safe for others to use. Your study data stays intact.\n\n***\n\n## Limitations\n\nBrowse Mode is intentionally limited to keep it simple:\n\n**Can't do:**\n\n* ❌ Edit card content (use [Edit Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/))\n* ❌ Delete cards (use [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/))\n* ❌ Add new cards (use [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/) or [Study Mode](/docs/study/))\n* ❌ Change card order (use [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/reordering/))\n* ❌ Filter by learning status (shows all cards)\n* ❌ Search for cards (use [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/#searching-cards))\n* ❌ Undo actions (no actions to undo)\n\n**Can do:**\n\n* ✅ View all cards in order\n* ✅ Swipe between cards\n* ✅ Zoom and resize sections\n* ✅ View HTML content\n* ✅ Read at your own pace\n\n***\n\n## Comparison: Browse vs. Study vs. List\n\n| Task | Browse Mode | Study Mode | Cards List |\n|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Quick preview all cards | ✅ Best | ❌ Only due cards | ⚠️ Grid view |\n| Active learning | ❌ No | ✅ Best | ❌ No |\n| Edit cards | ❌ No | ⚠️ One at a time | ✅ Best |\n| Search cards | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Best |\n| Reorder cards | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Best |\n| Safe for others | ✅ Yes | ❌ Affects progress | ⚠️ Could delete |\n| Swipe navigation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Scroll/tap |\n| Grading buttons | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n\n***\n\n## Tips\n\n### Use for Initial Review\n\n* Browse all cards in a new deck before your first study session\n* Helps gauge difficulty and time needed\n* Mentally prepare for what's coming\n\n### Check Before Sharing\n\n* Always browse your deck before sharing the database file\n* Catch typos, incomplete cards, or sensitive information\n* Make a good impression on recipients\n\n### Combine with Cards List\n\n* Browse Mode for quick visual scanning\n* Cards List for finding, editing, organizing\n* Each has its strengths\n\n### Don't Overthink It\n\n* Browse Mode is simple by design\n* Just view and swipe\n* No pressure, no tracking, no consequences\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Study Mode](/docs/study/) - Learn with spaced repetition\n* [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/) - Manage and organize cards\n* [Edit Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/) - Modify card content\n* [Deck Settings](/docs/settings/deck-settings/) - Configure deck behavior\n"

    "content": "GoCards supports basic HTML formatting in both terms and definitions, letting you create rich, visually appealing flashcards with bold text, images, lists, and more.\n\n## Supported HTML Tags\n\nGoCards renders HTML using a WebView, supporting common formatting tags:\n\n### Text Formatting\n\n| HTML | Result | Example |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `<b>text</b>` | **Bold** | `<b>Important</b>` |\n| `<strong>text</strong>` | **Bold** (semantic) | `<strong>Key concept</strong>` |\n| `<i>text</i>` | *Italic* | `<i>Emphasis</i>` |\n| `<em>text</em>` | *Italic* (semantic) | `<em>Foreign word</em>` |\n| `<u>text</u>` | Underline | `<u>Underlined</u>` |\n| `<br />` | Line break | `Line 1<br />Line 2` |\n\n### Lists\n\n**Unordered lists (bullets):**\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Item 1</li>\n  <li>Item 2</li>\n  <li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n**Ordered lists (numbers):**\n\n```html\n<ol>\n  <li>First step</li>\n  <li>Second step</li>\n  <li>Third step</li>\n</ol>\n```\n\n### Images\n\n**Basic image:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/image.png\" />\n```\n\n**Image with size:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/image.png\" width=\"300\" />\n```\n\n**Image with alt text:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/diagram.png\" alt=\"Cell structure diagram\" />\n```\n\n### Links\n\n**Clickable links:**\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://example.com\">Click here</a>\n```\n\nLinks are clickable in study/browse mode.\n\n### Headings\n\n```html\n<h1>Main Heading</h1>\n<h2>Subheading</h2>\n<h3>Smaller Heading</h3>\n```\n\n### Other Tags\n\n* `<p>Paragraph</p>` - Paragraph blocks\n* `<div>Container</div>` - Generic container\n* `<span>Inline text</span>` - Inline element\n* `<code>Code snippet</code>` - Monospace code\n* `<pre>Preformatted text</pre>` - Preserves spacing\n\n***\n\n## How to Add HTML Formatting\n\n### During Card Creation\n\n1. **Tap \"+\" to add card**\n2. **In term or definition field**, type HTML:\n   ```\n   What is <b>photosynthesis</b>?\n   ```\n3. **Save card**\n4. **HTML renders** in study mode\n\n### During Card Editing\n\n1. **Edit an existing card**\n2. **Add HTML tags** to term or definition\n3. **Save**\n4. **Preview in study mode** to verify rendering\n\n### In Excel/CSV (for sync)\n\n**When editing in Excel:**\n\n* **Term column:** `What is <b>mitosis</b>?`\n* **Definition column:** `Cell division into <i>two identical</i> cells`\n* **Sync to GoCards** - HTML renders automatically\n\n***\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Emphasize Key Terms\n\n**Original:**\n\n```\nTerm: What is photosynthesis?\nDefinition: Process where plants convert light to energy\n```\n\n**With HTML:**\n\n```\nTerm: What is <b>photosynthesis</b>?\nDefinition: Process where plants convert <b>light energy</b> to <b>chemical energy</b>\n```\n\n**Effect:** Important words stand out, easier to scan.\n\n***\n\n### Add Images to Definitions\n\n**Use case:** Diagram, photo, or illustration helps learning\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nTerm: What does a plant cell look like?\nDefinition: <img src=\"https://example.com/plant-cell.png\" width=\"300\" /><br />\nContains chloroplasts, cell wall, and large vacuole.\n```\n\n**Result:** Image displays with text explanation.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use `width=\"300\"` to control size (pixels)\n* Host images online (Google Drive, Imgur, etc.) for URLs\n* Smaller images load faster\n\n***\n\n### Create Lists\n\n**Use case:** Multiple points or steps\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nTerm: What are the steps of mitosis?\nDefinition:\n<ol>\n  <li>Prophase - Chromosomes condense</li>\n  <li>Metaphase - Chromosomes align at center</li>\n  <li>Anaphase - Sister chromatids separate</li>\n  <li>Telophase - Nuclear envelopes reform</li>\n</ol>\n```\n\n**Result:** Numbered list in study mode.\n\n***\n\n### Format Mathematical Expressions\n\n**Use case:** Equations, formulas, symbols\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nTerm: What is the Pythagorean theorem?\nDefinition: a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>\n```\n\n**Tags:**\n\n* `<sup>2</sup>` - Superscript (exponents)\n* `<sub>2</sub>` - Subscript (chemical formulas)\n\n**Result:** Proper mathematical notation.\n\n***\n\n### Add External Links\n\n**Use case:** Reference materials, further reading\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nTerm: Who is Albert Einstein?\nDefinition: Physicist who developed relativity theory.\n<br /><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\">Learn more</a>\n```\n\n**Result:** Tappable link opens in browser (from study mode).\n\n***\n\n### Bilingual Cards with Italics\n\n**Use case:** Language learning\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nTerm: How do you say \"hello\" in Spanish?\nDefinition: <i>Hola</i>\n```\n\n**Result:** Foreign word styled differently (italics).\n\n***\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Keep It Simple\n\n**✅ Good:**\n\n```html\n<b>Key term</b> with explanation\n```\n\n**❌ Overdone:**\n\n```html\n<div style=\"color:red;font-size:24px;background:yellow;border:5px solid blue;\">\n  <b><i><u>EXCESSIVE FORMATTING</u></i></b>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Why:** Simple HTML is more readable and consistent across devices.\n\n***\n\n### Test in Study Mode\n\n**Always preview:**\n\n1. Add HTML to card\n2. Save\n3. **Open study mode**\n4. Verify rendering looks good\n5. Adjust if needed\n\nDifferent HTML may render differently on various Android versions.\n\n***\n\n### Use Semantic Tags\n\n**Prefer semantic tags:**\n\n* `<strong>` over `<b>` (screen readers understand \"strong\" better)\n* `<em>` over `<i>` (semantic emphasis)\n\n**Why:** Better accessibility and future-proofing.\n\n***\n\n### Consistent Image Sizes\n\n**Set widths consistently:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"...\" width=\"300\" />\n<img src=\"...\" width=\"300\" />\n<img src=\"...\" width=\"300\" />\n```\n\n**Why:** Uniform appearance across cards.\n\n***\n\n### Host Images Reliably\n\n**Good hosting options:**\n\n* ✅ Google Drive (public link)\n* ✅ Imgur\n* ✅ Your own website\n* ⚠️ Dropbox (ensure public sharing)\n\n**Avoid:**\n\n* ❌ Local file paths (won't work on device)\n* ❌ Temporary hosting (links expire)\n\n***\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### HTML Shows as Plain Text\n\n**Problem:** You see `<b>text</b>` instead of **text**\n\n**Causes:**\n\n* HTML not properly formatted\n* Missing closing tags\n* Special characters not escaped\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Check for typos in tags\n2. Ensure every `<tag>` has `</tag>`\n3. Test with simple HTML first (`<b>test</b>`)\n\n***\n\n### Images Don't Display\n\n**Problem:** Image placeholder or broken icon\n\n**Causes:**\n\n* URL is incorrect or private\n* Image host is down\n* No internet connection\n* Image file too large\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Verify URL** - Open in browser to test\n2. **Check permissions** - Ensure image is public\n3. **Try smaller image** - Compress if large\n4. **Use reliable host** - Switch to Google Drive/Imgur\n\n***\n\n### Formatting Looks Weird\n\n**Problem:** Layout is broken or text overlaps\n\n**Causes:**\n\n* Complex nested HTML\n* CSS conflicts\n* Android version differences\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Simplify HTML** - Remove unnecessary tags\n2. **Test on device** - Different from computer preview\n3. **Avoid custom CSS** - Stick to basic HTML\n\n***\n\n### Line Breaks Not Working\n\n**Problem:** Text runs together\n\n**Solution:**\nUse `<br>` for line breaks:\n\n```html\nLine 1<br />\nLine 2<br />\nLine 3\n```\n\nOr use paragraph tags:\n\n```html\n<p>Paragraph 1</p>\n<p>Paragraph 2</p>\n```\n\n***\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Tables (if supported)\n\n**Simple table:**\n\n```html\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>Cell 1</td>\n    <td>Cell 2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Cell 3</td>\n    <td>Cell 4</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\n**Note:** Table support may vary. Test first.\n\n***\n\n### Special Characters\n\n**HTML entities:**\n\n* `&copy;` → ©\n* `&trade;` → ™\n* `&deg;` → °\n* `&nbsp;` → Non-breaking space\n* `&lt;` → `<`\n* `&gt;` → `>`\n* `&amp;` → `&`\n\n**Use when:** You need these symbols in your cards.\n\n***\n\n### Inline Styling (use sparingly)\n\n**Example:**\n\n```html\n<span style=\"color:red;\">Important</span>\n```\n\n**Caution:** Inline styles may not work consistently across devices.\n\n***\n\n## Formatting and File Sync\n\n### HTML in Excel/CSV\n\n**Excel cell content:**\n\n```\nWhat is <b>DNA</b>?\n```\n\n**When synced:**\n\n* GoCards imports HTML as-is\n* Renders in study mode\n* Appears as plain HTML in Excel (editable)\n\n**Tip:** Edit complex HTML in Excel (easier than mobile keyboard).\n\n***\n\n### Syncing Preserves Formatting\n\n**Round-trip preservation:**\n\n1. Add HTML in GoCards\n2. Sync to Excel\n3. Edit in Excel (add more HTML)\n4. Sync back to GoCards\n5. **All HTML preserved**\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Editing Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/) - Modify card content\n* [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) - Edit HTML in Excel\n* [Study Mode](/docs/study/) - See formatted cards during study\n* [Cards List](/docs/cards-list/) - Manage all your cards\n"

Tap card → Edit Card\n2. Fix: \"What is photosynthesis?\"\n3. Save\n4. Done in 5 seconds\n\n***\n\n### Add More Information\n\n**Problem:** Definition is too vague\n\n**Original:**\n\n* Term: \"Mitosis\"\n* Definition: \"Cell division\"\n\n**Improved:**\n\n* Term: \"Mitosis\"\n* Definition: \"Cell division where one cell divides into two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes\"\n\n**How:**\n\n1. Edit card\n2. Expand definition\n3. Save\n\n***\n\n### Clarify Ambiguity\n\n**Problem:** Card is confusing\n\n**Original:**\n\n* Term: \"The capital\"\n* Definition: \"Paris\"\n\n**Improved:**\n\n* Term: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n* Definition: \"Paris\"\n\n**Why:** Clearer question, easier to remember\n\n***\n\n### Split a Complex Card\n\n**Problem:** Card tries to teach too much\n\n**Original:**\n\n* Term: \"Explain photosynthesis\"\n* Definition: \"Photosynthesis is when plants convert light energy to chemical energy, using chlorophyll in chloroplasts, taking in CO2 and water, producing glucose and oxygen, happening in two stages: light-dependent and light-independent reactions...\"\n\n**Better:** Split into 4 cards:\n\n1. \"What is photosynthesis?\" → \"Process where plants convert light energy to chemical energy\"\n2. \"What molecule is used in photosynthesis?\" → \"Chlorophyll\"\n3. \"What are the inputs of photosynthesis?\" → \"CO2, water, light\"\n4. \"What are the outputs of photosynthesis?\" → \"Glucose, oxygen\"\n\n**How:**\n\n1. Edit original card (simplify)\n2. Add 3 new cards\n3. Each card = one concept\n\n***\n\n### Add an Image\n\n**Problem:** Text alone isn't enough\n\n**How:**\n\n1. Edit card\n2. Add HTML: `<img src=\"https://example.com/diagram.png\">`\n3. Save\n\nSee [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/) for image details.\n\n***\n\n## Bulk Editing\n\nNeed to edit many cards? Two approaches:\n\n### Option 1: Edit in GoCards\n\n**Pros:** Direct, immediate\n**Cons:** Tedious for many cards\n**Best for:** 1-10 cards\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. Open Cards List\n2. Edit each card one by one\n3. Save after each\n\n### Option 2: Export, Edit in Excel, Re-sync (Premium)\n\n**Pros:** Fast for bulk changes, powerful editing tools\n**Cons:** Requires Premium, extra steps\n**Best for:** 10+ cards\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. Export deck to Excel/CSV\n2. Edit in Excel (use find-replace, formulas, etc.)\n3. Save Excel file\n4. Sync back to GoCards\n\nSee [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for details.\n\n***\n\n## Undo Edits\n\n### Immediate Undo\n\nIf you just saved and regret it:\n\n1. **Tap the card again** → Edit Card\n2. **Re-type the original content** (if you remember)\n3. **Save**\n\nUnfortunately, there's no built-in \"undo edit\" button.\n\n### Restore from Backup\n\nIf you have a [database backup](/docs/home/database-backup/):\n\n1. **Export current database** (safety backup)\n2. **Import old database** (from before the edit)\n3. **Find the card** - original content restored\n\n**Warning:** This restores the entire database, losing any other changes made since the backup.\n\n***\n\n## Tips for Effective Editing\n\n### Edit While Studying\n\nWhen a card confuses you during study:\n\n* **Pause and edit it immediately**\n* Fix the confusion for next time\n* Your future self will thank you\n\n### Use Consistent Formatting\n\n* **Terms:** Always phrased as questions? Always single words? Be consistent\n* **Definitions:** Same structure across deck (e.g., always start with category)\n\n### Keep It Simple\n\n* **Shorter is better** - Easier to remember\n* **One fact per card** - Don't overload\n* **Clear language** - Avoid jargon unless necessary\n\n### Review Before Exams\n\n* **Edit outdated information** (dates, facts)\n* **Clarify confusing cards** you struggled with\n* **Add related info** that appeared in lectures\n\n### Track Sync Changes\n\nIf using [File Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/):\n\n* Edits in GoCards sync back to Excel\n* Check edge bars to see which cards changed\n* Excel \"Last Modified\" column shows GoCards edits\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/) - Use HTML for rich content\n* [Deleting Cards](/docs/cards-list/deleting/) - Remove cards you don't need\n* [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) - Edit in Excel and sync (Premium)\n* [Study Mode](/docs/study/) - See how edited cards appear during study\n"

Navigating between cards is as simple as sliding them left or right.\n\nAt the top, you will find the term, representing the front of the card.\nTake a moment to check if you still remember this card.\nThen when you are ready, click the bottom part to reveal the definition, representing the back of the card.\nBelow are buttons that allow you to assess how well you know the card.\n\n### “Again” and the limit forgotten cards\n\nIf you hit “Again”, the card stays in the stack and pops up again after studying and forgetting another 5 cards.\nYou have the flexibility to customize this value or disable the feature in the Deck Settings.\n\n### “Quick repetition”\n\nThe next button “Quick repetition” is designed for last-minute cramming e.g. before tomorrow's exam.\nTap it and the card reappears quite quickly, first after 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, followed by 20 minutes, and so on.\n\n### “Hard” and “Easy”\n\nDepending on how well you are confident with the material, use the 'Hard' or 'Easy' button.\n“Hard” brings the card back in 3 days, with subsequent intervals increasing the days by 1.5 times.\n“Easy” brings the card back in 5 days, with subsequent doubling days.\n\n### Gestures\n\nGoCards prioritizes an interactive user experience by avoiding complicated configuration options in the settings.\nInstead, it offers intuitive gestures for adjusting display settings.\nYou can change the aspect ratio of terms and definitions by moving a middle bar.\nYou can also adjust text size by zooming in or out.\nDisplay settings can be easily reset to their default setup using the \"Reset view\" menu option.\n\n### Actions\n\nIn the study mode you can also delete cards, edit cards and add create a new card.\n\n#### Undo\n\nHave you accidentally pressed the button or removed the card?\nDon’t worry, you can easily undo the last action by pressing the \"Back\" button. Let’s tap the rating button.\nChanged your mind? Just press “Back”. Let’s add a new card, now undo it.\nRemoved a card you didn't mean to? Let’s bring it back.\nTo exit the study mode, simply tap the back arrow located in the top toolbar.\nNow, let's move on to the next activity with a list of all the cards.\n\n## Cards list\n\nThe cards list offers a variety of features to help you manage your flashcards:\n\n* Search for cards using text\n* Rearrange the order of cards by dragging and dropping\n* Remove cards by swapping them away\n* Select multiple cards and paste them elsewhere or delete them\n* Edit existing cards\n* Add new cards anywhere you like\n"

It lets you edit flashcards on your computer (Excel/CSV) and sync them to your phone **without losing your learning progress**.\n\n### Is GoCards free?\n\n**Free version includes:**\n\n* ✅ Unlimited decks and cards\n* ✅ Study mode with spaced repetition\n* ✅ Basic card management\n* ✅ Database export/import\n\n**Premium features:**\n\n* Folders (organize decks)\n* Sync with Excel/CSV files\n* Auto-sync\n* Import/Export to Excel/CSV\n\n### How is GoCards different from Anki?\n\n* **Easier to use** - Simpler interface, less configuration\n* **File sync** - Unique ability to sync with Excel preserving progress\n* **Interactive gestures** - Pinch-to-zoom, slider adjustments\n* **Mobile-first** - Designed specifically for Android\n* **No desktop app** - Edit in Excel instead (simpler workflow)\n\n## Study & Learning\n\n### How does spaced repetition work?\n\nCards you mark \"Easy\" appear after longer intervals (5 days, then 10, 20, 40, etc.). Cards marked \"Hard\" have shorter intervals (3 days, then 4.5, 6.75, etc.). The algorithm optimizes review timing based on memory science.\n\nSee [Study Mode](/docs/study/) for details.\n\n### What if I mark \"Again\"?\n\nThe card stays in your current study session and reappears after you've studied/forgotten 5 more cards (configurable). This ensures you practice difficult cards immediately.\n\n### Can I study without internet?\n\nYes! GoCards works completely offline. Internet is only needed for:\n\n* Syncing with cloud storage files (Google Drive, Dropbox)\n* Downloading shared decks\n* Loading images from URLs in cards\n\n### How many cards should I study per day?\n\n**Beginners:** Start with 10-20 new cards per day\n**Experienced:** 20-50 new cards per day\n**Intensive:** 50+ new cards per day\n\nQuality matters more than quantity. Consistent daily practice beats occasional marathons.\n\n## Cards & Decks\n\n### Can I add images to cards?\n\nYes! Use HTML image tags: `<img src=\"URL\">`\n\nHost images online (Google Drive, Imgur) and include the URL in your card. See [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/) for details.\n\n### Can I use formatting (bold, italic)?\n\nYes! Use HTML tags:\n\n* `<b>Bold</b>` or `<strong>Strong</strong>`\n* `<i>Italic</i>` or `<em>Emphasis</em>`\n* `<u>Underline</u>`\n* Lists, line breaks, links supported\n\nSee [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/).\n\n### How many cards can I have?\n\nNo hard limit. Decks with 10,000+ cards are supported. Performance may vary based on device and card complexity (images, HTML).\n\n### Can I share decks with friends?\n\nYes! Two methods:\n\n1. **Export to Excel/CSV** (Premium) - Share content only, no progress\n2. **Export database** - Share entire deck with structure (no progress)\n\nThey import into their GoCards app. See [Export Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/export-cards/).\n\n## File Sync\n\n### What is file sync? (Premium)\n\nLink your deck to an Excel/CSV file. Edit cards on your computer in Excel, save, and changes sync to GoCards automatically - **without losing your study progress**. This is GoCards' killer feature!\n\nSee [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/).\n\n### Does sync work with Google Drive/Dropbox?\n\nYes! Save your Excel file to cloud storage, link it to your deck, and enable auto-sync. Edit from any computer, changes sync to your phone automatically.\n\nSee [Cloud Storage](/docs/sync-export-import/cloud-storage/).\n\n### Will syncing delete my progress?\n\nNo! Sync preserves:\n\n* ✅ Review intervals\n* ✅ Memorization status\n* ✅ Study history\n* ✅ Statistics\n\nOnly card **content** updates (terms, definitions). Your learning data stays intact.\n\n### What if I edit both the app and file?\n\n**Conflict resolution:** Newest change wins (based on timestamps). If you edited the file after last sync, file changes take priority. Always sync before editing in both places to avoid conflicts.\n\n## Premium Features\n\n### How do I get Premium?\n\n**In-app purchase:**\n\n* Open GoCards\n* Discover tab shows Premium offers\n* Follow prompts to purchase\n* One-time purchase or subscription (check current offer)\n\n### What happens if Premium expires?\n\n**You keep:**\n\n* All decks and cards\n* All learning progress\n* Ability to study\n\n**You lose access to:**\n\n* File sync (decks stay, can't sync anymore)\n* New folder creation (existing folders stay)\n* Import/Export Excel/CSV (database export still works)\n\n### Can I try Premium features?\n\nSome versions offer free trials. Check the Discover tab in the app for current promotions.\n\n## Technical\n\n### Which Android versions are supported?\n\nTypically Android 7.0+ (API level 24+). Check Play Store listing for current minimum version.\n\n### Does GoCards sync across devices?\n\nNot directly. Use these methods:\n\n* **Database export/import** - Manual transfer with full progress\n* **File sync (Premium)** - Content syncs, progress is per-device\n* **Cloud storage** - Content shared, each device has separate progress\n\n### Can I use GoCards on iPhone/iPad?\n\nNo, GoCards is Android-only currently. iOS version is not planned.\n\n### Where is my data stored?\n\n* **Local storage:** All data is on your device\n* **No cloud sync by default:** Your data stays private\n* **Optional cloud:** Only if you use file sync with cloud storage (you control access)\n\n### Is my data private?\n\nYes. GoCards:\n\n* ❌ Doesn't send your cards to servers\n* ❌ Doesn't track your study sessions\n* ❌ Doesn't require account creation\n* ✅ All data stays on your device (unless you use cloud storage)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Cards aren't syncing\n\nSee [Sync Troubleshooting](/docs/sync-export-import/troubleshooting/) for detailed solutions.\n\n### Import failed\n\nCheck [Import Cards - Troubleshooting](/docs/sync-export-import/import-cards/#troubleshooting).\n\n### App crashes or freezes\n\n1. **Update to latest version** (Play Store)\n2. **Restart device**\n3. **Clear app cache:** Settings → Apps → GoCards → Storage → Clear Cache\n4. **Reinstall app** (backup database first!)\n\n### Lost my decks after update\n\nYour data is preserved during updates. If decks are missing:\n\n1. Check \"All Decks\" tab (not just Recent)\n2. Restart app\n3. Check for accidental folder navigation (use back button)\n4. Restore from database backup if you have one\n\n## Still Have Questions?\n\n* **Discord Community:** Join for user-to-user help\n* **GitHub Issues:** Report bugs or request features\n* **Documentation:** Search other pages in this guide\n* **Discover Tab:** In-app support resources\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Tips & Best Practices](/docs/support/tips/) - Optimize your learning\n* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) - Initial setup guide\n* [Sync Troubleshooting](/docs/sync-export-import/troubleshooting/) - Sync issues\n"

    "title": "Tips & Best Practices",
    "description": "Expert tips for creating effective flashcards, optimizing your learning, and getting the most out of GoCards.",
    "content": "Expert advice for maximizing your learning with GoCards.\n\n## Creating Effective Flashcards\n\n### One Concept Per Card\n\n**❌ Bad:**\n\n* Term: \"What happened in World War 2?\"\n* Definition: \"Started 1939, ended 1945, involved Germany, Japan, Italy vs Allies, Holocaust, atomic bombs, 70 million died...\"\n\n**✅ Good:** Split into multiple cards:\n\n* \"When did World War 2 start?\" → \"1939\"\n* \"When did World War 2 end?\" → \"1945\"\n* \"How many people died in WW2?\" → \"Approximately 70 million\"\n\n**Why:** Easier to remember, precise grading, targeted practice.\n\n***\n\n### Use Clear Questions\n\n**❌ Bad:**\n\n* \"Mitosis\" → \"Cell division\"\n\n**✅ Good:**\n\n* \"What is mitosis?\" → \"Process of cell division resulting in two identical daughter cells\"\n\n**Why:** Clear prompts trigger better recall. Ambiguous terms confuse your brain.\n\n***\n\n### Keep Definitions Concise\n\n**❌ Bad:**\n\n* Term: \"What is photosynthesis?\"\n* Definition: \"Photosynthesis is a complex biochemical process that occurs in plants and certain microorganisms whereby light energy, typically from the sun, is converted into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules through a series of light-dependent and light-independent reactions involving chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide...\"\n\n**✅ Good:**\n\n* \"What is photosynthesis?\" → \"Process where plants convert light energy to chemical energy using CO2 and water, producing glucose and oxygen\"\n\n**Why:** Concise = faster reviews, less cognitive load, easier grading.\n\n***\n\n### Use Examples When Helpful\n\n**Good:**\n\n* \"What is an adverb?\" → \"A word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. Examples: quickly, very, extremely\"\n\n**Why:** Examples make abstract concepts concrete.\n\n***\n\n### Add Context to Ambiguous Terms\n\n**❌ Bad:**\n\n* \"The capital\" → \"Paris\"\n\n**✅ Good:**\n\n* \"What is the capital of France?\" → \"Paris\"\n\n**Why:** Context prevents confusion and aids recall.\n\n***\n\n## Studying Effectively\n\n### Study Daily (Consistency > Duration)\n\n**✅ Better:** 15 minutes every day\n**❌ Worse:** 2 hours once a week\n\n**Why:** Spaced repetition requires regular reviews. Daily practice builds long-term memory.\n\n***\n\n### Be Honest with Grading\n\n**Don't:**\n\n* Mark \"Easy\" when you hesitated\n* Mark \"Hard\" to see cards more often (defeats algorithm)\n* Always mark \"Again\" (algorithm needs accurate feedback)\n\n**Do:**\n\n* Grade based on actual recall difficulty\n* Use \"Again\" freely when you forget\n* Trust the algorithm\n\n**Why:** Accurate grading optimizes review intervals.\n\n***\n\n### Focus on Weak Cards\n\n**During study:**\n\n* Don't rush through \"Again\" cards\n* Spend time understanding why you forgot\n* Consider editing confusing cards immediately\n\n**After study:**\n\n* Review forgotten cards in list view (red edge bar)\n* Edit unclear definitions\n* Split overly complex cards\n\n***\n\n### Take Breaks\n\n**Recommended:**\n\n* 5-minute break every 30 minutes\n* Longer break after 1-2 hours\n* Never exceed 3 hours in one session\n\n**Why:** Mental fatigue hurts retention. Breaks improve focus.\n\n***\n\n### Use Multiple Senses\n\n**Enhance cards with:**\n\n* Images (diagrams, photos)\n* Read term aloud during study\n* Visualize the concept\n* Create mental associations\n\n**Why:** Multi-sensory learning improves memory.\n\n***\n\n## Deck Organization\n\n### Start Small\n\n**New to flashcards?**\n\n* Begin with 20-50 cards\n* Master these first\n* Gradually add more\n\n**Why:** Success builds momentum. Starting too big causes overwhelm.\n\n***\n\n### Group Related Content\n\n**Use folders (Premium) or naming:**\n\n* `Spanish 1 - Greetings`\n* `Spanish 1 - Food`\n* `Spanish 1 - Travel`\n\nOr separate decks:\n\n* `Biology - Cell Structure`\n* `Biology - Genetics`\n* `Biology - Evolution`\n\n**Why:** Easier to find, maintains context, allows targeted study.\n\n***\n\n### Separate Learning Stages\n\n**Consider:**\n\n* Deck 1: \"Spanish - Active Learning\" (currently studying)\n* Deck 2: \"Spanish - Mastered\" (long intervals)\n* Deck 3: \"Spanish - Archive\" (completed course)\n\n**Why:** Keeps active deck focused, reduces clutter.\n\n***\n\n### Use Descriptive Names\n\n**✅ Good:**\n\n* `Medical Terminology - Cardiovascular`\n* `Java Programming - Data Structures`\n* `History - American Revolution`\n\n**❌ Bad:**\n\n* `Deck 1`\n* `Cards`\n* `Study`\n\n**Why:** Find decks quickly, remember contents, professional appearance when sharing.\n\n***\n\n## File Sync Workflow (Premium)\n\n### Computer-First for Bulk Creation\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Create 100 cards in Excel (fast typing, formulas)\n2. Save to Google Drive\n3. Import to GoCards\n4. Link file and enable auto-sync\n5. Future edits sync automatically\n\n**Why:** Computer keyboard >> phone keyboard for bulk entry.\n\n***\n\n### Sync Regularly\n\n**Best practice:**\n\n* Edit file on computer\n* Save immediately\n* Open deck in GoCards (triggers sync)\n* Verify changes appear\n\n**Don't:**\n\n* Edit in multiple places without syncing\n* Let days pass between syncs\n* Forget which version is newer\n\n***\n\n### Use Excel Features\n\n**Leverage:**\n\n* **Find-replace:** Fix typos across all cards\n* **Sort:** Organize by difficulty, topic\n* **Formulas:** Generate similar cards automatically\n* **Comments:** Add notes (ignored by GoCards)\n\n**Example formula:**\n\n```text\n=CONCATENATE(\"What is \", A2, \"?\")\n```\n\nGenerates questions from list of terms.\n\n***\n\n## Advanced Tips\n\n### Cloze Deletion Alternative\n\nGoCards doesn't have built-in cloze, but you can simulate:\n\n**Card 1:**\n\n* \"The mitochondria is the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ of the cell\" → \"powerhouse\"\n\n**Card 2:**\n\n* \"The \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is the powerhouse of the cell\" → \"mitochondria\"\n\n**Why:** Tests recall from different angles.\n\n***\n\n### Progressive Difficulty\n\n**Order cards:**\n\n* Easy concepts first (build confidence)\n* Medium difficulty middle\n* Hardest at end\n\nOr reverse for challenge-first approach.\n\nSee [Reordering Cards](/docs/cards-list/reordering/).\n\n***\n\n### Use HTML for Rich Content\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* `<b>Bold</b>` for emphasis\n* `<img src=\"URL\">` for diagrams\n* `<ul><li>Lists</li></ul>` for steps\n* `<br>` for line breaks\n\nSee [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/).\n\n***\n\n### Regular Maintenance\n\n**Weekly:**\n\n* Review forgotten cards (red edge bar)\n* Fix confusing cards\n* Remove duplicates\n* Add cards for gaps in knowledge\n\n**Monthly:**\n\n* Export database backup\n* Reorganize deck structure\n* Archive completed decks\n\n***\n\n### Optimize Settings\n\n**Experiment with:**\n\n* Forgotten card limit (5-20)\n* Max lines display (2-5)\n* Dark mode (personal preference)\n\n**Start with defaults**, adjust based on experience.\n\nSee [Settings](/docs/settings/).\n\n***\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### ❌ Making Cards Too Long\n\n**Problem:** Walls of text intimidate and slow study.\n\n**Solution:** Break into smaller cards or summarize.\n\n***\n\n### ❌ Creating Cards You Don't Understand\n\n**Problem:** Memorizing without understanding leads to fragile knowledge.\n\n**Solution:** Learn concept first, then create flashcard.\n\n***\n\n### ❌ Ignoring \"Again\" Cards\n\n**Problem:** Skipping difficult cards = gaps in knowledge.\n\n**Solution:** Face weak spots head-on. Edit confusing cards.\n\n***\n\n### ❌ Studying Only Before Exams\n\n**Problem:** Cramming works short-term, fails long-term.\n\n**Solution:** Daily study throughout semester/course.\n\n***\n\n### ❌ Perfectionism\n\n**Problem:** Waiting to create \"perfect\" cards delays learning.\n\n**Solution:** Create cards now, refine later. Progress > perfection.\n\n***\n\n## Learning Resources\n\n### Spaced Repetition Research\n\n* \"Make It Stick\" by Peter C.

Use [Database Export](/docs/home/database-backup/) to include learning progress.\n\n***\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Excel/CSV Column Layout\n\n| Column A | Column B | Column C (optional) |\n|----------|----------|---------------------|\n| Term | Definition | Disabled |\n| What is DNA? | Deoxyribonucleic acid... | FALSE |\n| Capital of France? | Paris | FALSE |\n| What is H2O? | Water | FALSE |\n\n**Column details:**\n\n* **Term** - Front of flashcard (question/prompt)\n* **Definition** - Back of flashcard (answer)\n* **Disabled** - TRUE/FALSE (optional, if card is disabled)\n\n**Header row:** First row contains column names (\"Term\", \"Definition\", \"Disabled\")\n\n***\n\n## Editing Exported Files\n\n### In Microsoft Excel\n\n1. **Open** the exported .xlsx file\n2. **Edit cells** as needed:\n   * Add new rows (new cards)\n   * Delete rows (remove cards)\n   * Modify terms/definitions\n   * Reorder rows (changes card order)\n3. **Save** the file\n4. **Sync or re-import** to GoCards\n\n***\n\n### In Google Sheets\n\n1. **Upload** .xlsx or .csv to Google Drive\n2. **Open with Google Sheets**\n3. **Edit** as needed\n4. **Download** as .xlsx or .csv\n5. **Sync or re-import** to GoCards\n\n**Tip:** Keep the file in Google Drive and use [Cloud Storage Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/cloud-storage/) for automatic updates.\n\n***\n\n### In Text Editor (CSV only)\n\n1. **Open** .csv in Notepad, VS Code, etc.\n2. **Edit** carefully (CSV format is sensitive)\n   ```csv\n   Term,Definition,Disabled\n   \"What is DNA?\",\"Deoxyribonucleic acid\",FALSE\n   \"Capital of France?\",\"Paris\",FALSE\n   ```\n3. **Save** with UTF-8 encoding\n4. **Sync or re-import** to GoCards\n\n**Warning:** Easy to break CSV format. Use Excel/Sheets if possible.\n\n***\n\n## After Exporting: Next Steps\n\n### Option 1: One-Time Edit & Re-Import\n\n1. Export deck\n2. Edit in Excel\n3. **Import** the edited file as a new deck or replace existing\n4. See [Import Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/import-cards/)\n\n**Use when:** Making a one-time bulk edit\n\n***\n\n### Option 2: Set Up Ongoing Sync (Premium)\n\n1. Export deck (creates initial file)\n2. Save to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)\n3. **Link file to deck** (Deck Settings → \"Sync with file\")\n4. **Enable auto-sync** (syncs on deck open/close)\n5. Edit file anytime, changes sync automatically\n6. See [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/)\n\n**Use when:** Regularly editing cards on computer\n\n***\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Create Template Deck\n\n**Scenario:** Create 100 cards with structured format\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Create empty deck in GoCards\n2. Export to Excel\n3. **Use Excel formulas** to generate cards:\n   * Column A: `=\"What is \" & C2 & \"?\"`\n   * Column B: `=D2` (definition from another column)\n   * Fill down 100 rows\n4. Import back to GoCards\n5. **Result:** 100 formatted cards in seconds\n\n***\n\n### Share with Study Group\n\n**Scenario:** Everyone needs same flashcards for exam\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Create/export your deck\n2. **Upload to shared cloud folder** (Google Drive, Dropbox)\n3. **Share link** with group\n4. They **import to their GoCards**\n5. Everyone has identical cards (but separate learning progress)\n\n***\n\n### Backup Before Major Changes\n\n**Scenario:** About to reorganize deck, want safety net\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Export deck to Excel\n2. **Save with date** (e.g., `Biology-2025-12-29.xlsx`)\n3. Make changes in GoCards\n4. **If something goes wrong:** Import the backup file\n\n***\n\n### Migrate from Another App\n\n**Scenario:** Moving flashcards from Anki, Quizlet, etc.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. **Export from other app** (usually to CSV/text)\n2. **Open in Excel**, format to GoCards structure (Term, Definition columns)\n3. Save as .xlsx or .csv\n4. **Import to GoCards**\n5. Start studying immediately\n\n***\n\n## Tips for Successful Exporting\n\n### Name Files Descriptively\n\n**Good:**\n\n* `Spanish-Verbs-Advanced-2025-12-29.xlsx`\n* `Biology-Chapter3-Cells.xlsx`\n\n**Bad:**\n\n* `export.xlsx` (which deck is this?)\n* `deck123.csv` (not descriptive)\n\n***\n\n### Save to Cloud Storage\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Automatic backup\n* Access from multiple devices\n* Easy sharing\n* Enable auto-sync (Premium)\n\n**Services:**\n\n* Google Drive\n* Dropbox\n* OneDrive\n* iCloud (limited)\n\n***\n\n### Keep Original Exports\n\n**Before major edits:**\n\n1. Export deck\n2. **Rename** to `DeckName-ORIGINAL.xlsx`\n3. **Duplicate** the file\n4. Edit the duplicate\n5. **If editing fails:** You still have the original\n\n***\n\n### Test With Small Deck First\n\n**Before exporting your 1000-card deck:**\n\n1. Create a 5-card test deck\n2. Export it\n3. Edit in Excel\n4. Re-import or sync\n5. **Verify everything works**\n6. Then do your large deck\n\n***\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSee [Sync Troubleshooting](/docs/sync-export-import/troubleshooting/) for detailed solutions.\n\n### Export Button Grayed Out\n\n**Cause:** Premium feature not unlocked\n\n**Solution:** Upgrade to GoCards Premium\n\n***\n\n### File Won't Open in Excel\n\n**Cause:** Corrupted export or unsupported Excel version\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Try opening in Google Sheets instead\n2. Re-export the deck\n3. Update Excel to latest version\n\n***\n\n### Export Takes Too Long\n\n**Cause:** Very large deck (thousands of cards) or large images\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* Be patient (may take 30+ seconds)\n* Ensure good device storage\n* Minimize images in cards\n* Split into smaller decks before exporting\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Import Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/import-cards/) - Import Excel/CSV files\n* [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) - Bi-directional auto-sync (Premium)\n* [File Format Guide](/docs/sync-export-import/file-format/) - Detailed file structure specs\n* [Cloud Storage Setup](/docs/sync-export-import/cloud-storage/) - Use with Google Drive/Dropbox\n* [Database Backup](/docs/home/database-backup/) - Full backup including progress\n"

Instead:\n\n* Use HTML image tags: `<img src=\"URL\">`\n* Host images online (Google Drive, Imgur, etc.)\n* Include URL in cell content\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nDefinition: <img src=\"https://example.com/diagram.png\" /><br />Diagram shows cell structure\n```\n\n### Multiple Sheets\n\n**GoCards reads only the first sheet (Sheet1)**\n\n* Additional sheets ignored during import/sync\n* Keep all cards on Sheet1\n* Other sheets can store notes, references (won't import)\n\n### Additional Columns\n\n**Extra columns are allowed:**\n\n* Columns beyond Term, Definition, Disabled are ignored by GoCards\n* Useful for: notes, tags, sources, chapter numbers\n* **Preserved during sync** - GoCards won't delete them\n* Rows stay together during sync (extra data moves with card)\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nTerm | Definition | Disabled | Chapter | Notes\n```\n\nGoCards uses first 3 columns, preserves last 2.\n\n## CSV Format (.csv)\n\n### Basic Structure\n\n```csv\nTerm,Definition,Disabled\n\"What is DNA?\",\"Deoxyribonucleic acid\",FALSE\n\"Capital of France?\",\"Paris\",FALSE\n```\n\n### CSV Rules\n\n**Commas:**\n\n* Field separator is comma\n* Values containing commas must be quoted: `\"Hello, world\"`\n\n**Quotes:**\n\n* Use double quotes `\"` to enclose values with commas\n* Escape quotes inside values: `\"He said \"\"Hello\"\"\"`\n\n**Line breaks:**\n\n* Values with line breaks must be quoted\n* Line breaks preserved within quotes\n\n**Encoding:**\n\n* **UTF-8** encoding required for special characters\n* ANSI/ASCII may corrupt accented characters\n\n### Saving CSV Properly\n\n**From Excel:**\n\n1. File → Save As → CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)\n2. **Not:** CSV (Comma delimited) - This uses ANSI encoding\n\n**From Google Sheets:**\n\n1. File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)\n2. Automatically uses UTF-8\n\n**From text editor:**\n\n1. Use UTF-8 encoding (not ANSI)\n2. Save with .csv extension\n\n### CSV Limitations\n\nCompared to Excel:\n\n* ❌ No cell formatting (bold, colors, etc.)\n* ❌ More prone to encoding issues\n* ❌ Easy to break with manual editing\n* ✅ Smaller file size\n* ✅ Universal compatibility\n\n**Recommendation:** Use Excel (.xlsx) unless you have specific need for CSV.\n\n## Data Validation\n\n### Valid Values\n\n**Term column:**\n\n* Non-empty text\n* HTML allowed\n* Special characters allowed\n* Recommended: 1-200 characters\n\n**Definition column:**\n\n* Non-empty text\n* HTML allowed\n* Special characters allowed\n* Can be longer than Term\n\n**Disabled column:**\n\n* `TRUE` or `FALSE` (case-insensitive)\n* `true`, `True`, `TRUE` all work\n* Empty cells treated as FALSE\n* Other values (1/0, Yes/No) may not work\n\n### Empty Rows\n\n* Empty rows skipped during import\n* Don't affect sync\n* Safe to leave blank rows between groups of cards\n\n### Invalid Data\n\n**What happens:**\n\n* Rows with empty Term or Definition are skipped\n* Warning may be shown\n* Other valid rows still import\n\n## File Size Considerations\n\n### Performance\n\n| Cards | File Size (approx) | Import Time |\n|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| 100 | 50 KB | \\<1 second |\n| 1,000 | 500 KB | 2-3 seconds |\n| 10,000 | 5 MB | 10-20 seconds |\n\n**With images (embedded URLs):**\n\n* URL text is tiny (file size barely increases)\n* Actual images aren't in file (hosted externally)\n* Sync time depends on image download\n\n### Limits\n\n**Practical limits:**\n\n* **Cards per deck:** 10,000+ supported (may be slow)\n* **Text per cell:** Essentially unlimited\n* **File size:** Android system limits (usually 100+ MB fine)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Split very large decks (1000+ cards) for better performance\n* Keep images under 500KB each for fast loading\n* Compress images before hosting\n\n## Example Files\n\n### Minimal Valid File\n\n```\nTerm,Definition\nWhat is DNA?,Deoxyribonucleic acid\nCapital of France?,Paris\n```\n\n### Complete Example\n\n```\nTerm,Definition,Disabled\n\"What is <b>DNA</b>?\",\"Deoxyribonucleic acid - genetic material\",FALSE\n\"Capital of France?\",\"<b>Paris</b><br />Population: ~2.2 million\",FALSE\n\"H<sub>2</sub>O formula?\",\"Water (2 hydrogen, 1 oxygen)\",FALSE\n\"Difficult card\",\"I always forget this\",TRUE\n```\n\n### With Extra Columns\n\n```\nTerm,Definition,Disabled,Chapter,Source\nWhat is DNA?,Deoxyribonucleic acid,FALSE,1,Textbook p.45\nCapital of France?,Paris,FALSE,3,Geography notes\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting Format Issues\n\n### Import Fails - Check:\n\n1. ✅ Header row has \"Term\" and \"Definition\"\n2. ✅ At least one data row exists\n3. ✅ File extension is .xlsx or .csv\n4. ✅ File isn't corrupted (opens in Excel)\n\n### Sync Issues - Check:\n\n1. ✅ File structure unchanged (same columns)\n2. ✅ File encoding is correct (UTF-8 for CSV)\n3. ✅ No locked/read-only file\n4. ✅ File hasn't been moved/renamed\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Import Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/import-cards/) - How to import files\n* [Export Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/export-cards/) - How to export files\n* [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) - How syncing works\n* [Troubleshooting](/docs/sync-export-import/troubleshooting/) - Solve problems\n"

Everyone has same cards (separate progress)\n\n***\n\n## Preparing Files for Import\n\n### In Excel\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n1. **Open Excel** → Create new workbook\n2. **First row:** Type headers: `Term`, `Definition`, `Disabled`\n3. **Second row onward:** Enter your cards\n4. **Format cells:** Plain text or general (avoid date formatting)\n5. **Save as:** .xlsx (Excel) or .csv (CSV)\n6. **Transfer to phone** (cloud storage, email, etc.)\n7. **Import to GoCards**\n\n***\n\n### In Google Sheets\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n1. **Create new Google Sheet**\n2. **Add headers and cards** (same as Excel)\n3. **File → Download** → Choose format:\n   * Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)\n   * Comma-separated values (.csv)\n4. **Download to phone** or save to Google Drive\n5. **Import to GoCards**\n\n***\n\n### CSV Format Details\n\n**Example CSV file:**\n\n```csv\nTerm,Definition,Disabled\n\"What is DNA?\",\"Deoxyribonucleic acid\",FALSE\n\"Capital of France?\",\"Paris\",FALSE\n```\n\n**CSV Rules:**\n\n* Comma-separated values\n* Quotes around values with commas: `\"Hello, world\"`\n* UTF-8 encoding (for special characters)\n* Header row required\n\n**Tip:** Excel handles CSV formatting automatically. Manual CSV editing can be error-prone.\n\n***\n\n## After Importing\n\n### Verify Import Success\n\n1. **Open the newly created deck**\n2. **Tap \"List Cards\"**\n3. **Scroll through** to verify all cards imported\n4. **Check counts:** Does card count match file row count?\n\n***\n\n### Edit Imported Cards\n\nIf formatting needs adjustment:\n\n1. Use [Edit Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/) to fix individual cards\n2. Or [Export](/docs/sync-export-import/export-cards/), edit in Excel, re-import\n3. Or set up [Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for ongoing edits\n\n***\n\n### Organize Imported Deck\n\n1. **Rename deck** (if default name isn't good)\n2. **Move to folder** (organize with other decks)\n3. **Reorder cards** (see [Reordering](/docs/cards-list/reordering/))\n4. **Start studying!**\n\n***\n\n## Import vs. Sync\n\n| Feature | Import | Sync |\n|---------|--------|------|\n| **Creates new deck** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n| **One-time operation** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n| **Ongoing bi-directional updates** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |\n| **Preserves learning progress** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |\n| **Auto-sync option** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |\n\n**Use Import for:** Creating new decks from files\n\n**Use Sync for:** Ongoing editing workflow (see [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/))\n\n***\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Import Failed - \"Invalid File Format\"\n\n**Causes:**\n\n* File doesn't have \"Term\" and \"Definition\" columns\n* Header row is missing\n* File is corrupted\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Open file in Excel to verify structure\n2. Ensure first row has headers: `Term`, `Definition`\n3. Check for special characters in headers\n4. Try re-saving as .xlsx or .csv\n\n***\n\n### Import Failed - \"No Cards Found\"\n\n**Causes:**\n\n* File is empty (only header row)\n* All rows after header are empty\n* Columns are in wrong order\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Verify file has data rows (not just header)\n2. Check columns are named exactly \"Term\" and \"Definition\"\n3. Remove any completely empty rows\n\n***\n\n### Cards Imported But Look Wrong\n\n**Problems:**\n\n* Text is cut off\n* Formatting is missing\n* Special characters show as \"?\" or boxes\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **HTML formatting:** Ensure HTML tags are intact in Excel\n2. **Encoding:** Save CSV with UTF-8 encoding\n3. **Special characters:** Use Excel (.xlsx) instead of CSV for better support\n\n***\n\n### Duplicate Deck Created\n\n**Problem:** Import created new deck instead of adding to existing\n\n**Explanation:** Import always creates a new deck.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n* Use [Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) to update existing deck\n* Or use [Multi-Select](/docs/cards-list/multi-select/) to move cards between decks\n* Or delete duplicate and re-import differently\n\n***\n\n## Tips for Successful Import\n\n### Test With Small File First\n\n**Before importing 1000 cards:**\n\n1. Create test file with 5 cards\n2. Import to GoCards\n3. Verify formatting, encoding, structure\n4. Then import your full file\n\n***\n\n### Use Excel Over CSV\n\n**Excel (.xlsx) advantages:**\n\n* Less prone to formatting errors\n* Better handles special characters\n* Easier to edit\n* More forgiving of content with commas\n\n***\n\n### Name Files Descriptively\n\n**Good filenames:**\n\n* `Spanish-Vocabulary-Level1.xlsx`\n* `Biology-Final-Exam.csv`\n\n**Bad filenames:**\n\n* `cards.xlsx` (too generic)\n* `deck1.csv` (not descriptive)\n\n**Why:** Imported deck name comes from filename\n\n***\n\n### Prepare File on Computer\n\n**Don't:**\n\n* Create file on phone (tiny keyboard, formatting issues)\n\n**Do:**\n\n* Use computer with Excel/Google Sheets\n* Leverage formulas, find-replace, bulk editing\n* Transfer finished file to phone\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Export Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/export-cards/) - Export decks to Excel/CSV\n* [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) - Set up ongoing sync instead of one-time import\n* [File Format Guide](/docs/sync-export-import/file-format/) - Detailed file structure specifications\n* [Cloud Storage](/docs/sync-export-import/cloud-storage/) - Import from Google Drive/Dropbox\n* [Troubleshooting](/docs/sync-export-import/troubleshooting/) - Solve import problems\n"
